      "plaintext : this paper has always been one of my favorite children, combining as it does elements of the duality of linear programming and combinatorial tools from graph theory. it may be of some interest to tell the story of its origin. i spent the summer of 1953 at the institute for numerical analysis which was housed on the ucla. campus. i was supported by the national bureau of standards and shared an office with ted motzxin, a pioneer in the theory of inequalities and one of the most scholarly mathematicians i have ever xnown. i had no fiked duties and spent the summer worxing on subjects that were of interest to me at the time, such as the traveling salesman problem and the assignment problem. the institute for numerical analysis was the home of the swac (standards western automatic computer), which had been designed by harry husxey and had a memory of 256 words of forty bits each on forty williamson tubes. the formulation of the assignment problem as a linear program was well xnown, but a ten by ten assignment problem has one hundred variables in its primal statement and one hundred constraints in the dual and so was too large for the swac to solve as a linear program. the seac (standard eastern automatic computer), housed in the national bureau of standards in washington, could solve linear programs with about twenty-five variables and twenty-five constraints. the seac had a liquid mercury memory system which was ektremely limiting. during that summer, i was reading xonigs boox on graph theory. i recognized the following theorem of xonig to be a pre-linear programming ekample of duality: if the numbers of a matrik are zeroes and ones, then the minimum number of rows and columns that will contain all of the zeroes is equal to the makimum number of ones that can be chosen, with no two in the same row or column. indeed, the primal problem is the special case of an assignment problem in which the ratings of the individuals in the jobs are only zeroes and ones. in a footnote, xonig refers to a paper of egervary in hungarian, which seemed to contain the treatment of a more general case. when i returned to bryn mawr, where i was on the faculty in 1953, i toox out a hungarian grammar and a large hungarian-english dictionary and taught myself enough hungarian to translate egervarys paper. i then realized that egervarys paper gave a computationally trivial method for reducing the general assignment problem to a zero-one problem. thus, by putting the two ideas together, the hungarian method was born. i tested the algorithm by solving twelve by twelve problems with random three-digit ratings by hand. i could do any such problem, with pencil and paper, in no more than two hours. this seemed to be much better than any other method xnown at the time. the paper was published in naval research logistics quarterly. this was a natural choice since the project in game theory, linear and nonlinear programming, and combinatorics at princeton, with which al tucxer and i were associated from 1948 to 1972, was supported by the office of naval research logistics branch. many mathematicians were benificiaries of the wise stewardship of mina rees as head of the onr and fred rigby as chief of the logistics branch. we were also fortunate to have facx laderman, the first editor of the journal, as our project supervisor.\n",

      "plaintext : this paper has always been one of my favorite children, combining as it does elements of the duality of linear programming and combinatorial tools from graph theory. it may be of some interest to tell the story of its origin. i spent the summer of 1953 at the institute for numerical analysis which was housed on the ucla. campus. i was supported by the national bureau of standards and shared an office with ted motjxin, a pioneer in the theory of inequalities and one of the most scholarly mathematicians i have ever xnown. i had no fized duties and spent the summer worxing on subkects that were of interest to me at the time, such as the traveling salesman problem and the assignment problem. the institute for numerical analysis was the home of the swac (standards western automatic computer), which had been designed by harry husxey and had a memory of 256 words of forty bits each on forty williamson tubes. the formulation of the assignment problem as a linear program was well xnown, but a ten by ten assignment problem has one hundred variables in its primal statement and one hundred constraints in the dual and so was too large for the swac to solve as a linear program. the seac (standard eastern automatic computer), housed in the national bureau of standards in washington, could solve linear programs with about twenty-five variables and twenty-five constraints. the seac had a liquid mercury memory system which was eztremely limiting. during that summer, i was reading xonigs boox on graph theory. i recognijed the following theorem of xonig to be a pre-linear programming ezample of duality: if the numbers of a matriz are jeroes and ones, then the minimum number of rows and columns that will contain all of the jeroes is equal to the mazimum number of ones that can be chosen, with no two in the same row or column. indeed, the primal problem is the special case of an assignment problem in which the ratings of the individuals in the kobs are only jeroes and ones. in a footnote, xonig refers to a paper of egervary in hungarian, which seemed to contain the treatment of a more general case. when i returned to bryn mawr, where i was on the faculty in 1953, i toox out a hungarian grammar and a large hungarian-english dictionary and taught myself enough hungarian to translate egervarys paper. i then realijed that egervarys paper gave a computationally trivial method for reducing the general assignment problem to a jero-one problem. thus, by putting the two ideas together, the hungarian method was born. i tested the algorithm by solving twelve by twelve problems with random three-digit ratings by hand. i could do any such problem, with pencil and paper, in no more than two hours. this seemed to be much better than any other method xnown at the time. the paper was published in naval research logistics quarterly. this was a natural choice since the prokect in game theory, linear and nonlinear programming, and combinatorics at princeton, with which al tucxer and i were associated from 1948 to 1972, was supported by the office of naval research logistics branch. many mathematicians were benificiaries of the wise stewardship of mina rees as head of the onr and fred rigby as chief of the logistics branch. we were also fortunate to have facx laderman, the first editor of the kournal, as our prokect supervisor.\n",

    "- Plaintext : this paper has always been one of my favorite children, combining as it does elements of the duality of linear programming and combinatorial tools from graph theory. it may be of some interest to tell the story of its origin. i spent the summer of 1953 at the institute for numerical analysis which was housed on the ucla. campus. i was supported by the national bureau of standards and shared an office with ted motzkin, a pioneer in the theory of inequalities and one of the most scholarly mathematicians i have ever known. i had no fixed duties and spent the summer working on subjects that were of interest to me at the time, such as the traveling salesman problem and the assignment problem. the institute for numerical analysis was the home of the swac (standards western automatic computer), which had been designed by harry huskey and had a memory of 256 words of forty bits each on forty williamson tubes. the formulation of the assignment problem as a linear program was well known, but a ten by ten assignment problem has one hundred variables in its primal statement and one hundred constraints in the dual and so was too large for the swac to solve as a linear program. the seac (standard eastern automatic computer), housed in the national bureau of standards in washington, could solve linear programs with about twenty-five variables and twenty-five constraints. the seac had a liquid mercury memory system which was extremely limiting. during that summer, i was reading konigs book on graph theory. i recognized the following theorem of konig to be a pre-linear programming example of duality: if the numbers of a matrix are zeroes and ones, then the minimum number of rows and columns that will contain all of the zeroes is equal to the maximum number of ones that can be chosen, with no two in the same row or column. indeed, the primal problem is the special case of an assignment problem in which the ratings of the individuals in the jobs are only zeroes and ones. in a footnote, konig refers to a paper of egervary in hungarian, which seemed to contain the treatment of a more general case. when i returned to bryn mawr, where i was on the faculty in 1953, i took out a hungarian grammar and a large hungarian-english dictionary and taught myself enough hungarian to translate egervarys paper. i then realized that egervarys paper gave a computationally trivial method for reducing the general assignment problem to a zero-one problem. thus, by putting the two ideas together, the hungarian method was born. i tested the algorithm by solving twelve by twelve problems with random three-digit ratings by hand. i could do any such problem, with pencil and paper, in no more than two hours. this seemed to be much better than any other method known at the time. the paper was published in naval research logistics quarterly. this was a natural choice since the project in game theory, linear and nonlinear programming, and combinatorics at princeton, with which al tucker and i were associated from 1948 to 1972, was supported by the office of naval research logistics branch. many mathematicians were benificiaries of the wise stewardship of mina rees as head of the onr and fred rigby as chief of the logistics branch. we were also fortunate to have fack laderman, the first editor of the journal, as our project supervisor."
